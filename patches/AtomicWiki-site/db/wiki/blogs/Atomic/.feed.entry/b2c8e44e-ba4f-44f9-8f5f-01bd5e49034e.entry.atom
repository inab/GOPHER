AtomicWiki started as an experiment to create a simple blog on top of eXist's existing <em>Atom</em> support. Eventually, more and more features were added during the past months, so the project has more evolved into a wiki-style system than "just" a weblog.</p><p>AtomicWiki is entirely based on the <em>Atom Publishing Protocol</em> and syndication format. All entries are stored as Atom feeds in eXist. We use the Atom Publishing Protocol to create and manipulate feeds and entries.
