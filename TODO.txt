DONE
====
*	Consider allowing more than one 'baseline' element, so we can have in
	place cummulative historical information.
*	Added a 'timeStamp' attribute to 'baseline' element, so different baselines are labeled.
*	Rename 'publicId' attribute to 'id'.
*	Removed attribute 'level' from element 'target', because successive 'baseline' information elements should explain with facts how difficult is a target.
*	Some sample Ruby and Python programs still had 'score' and 'e-value' attributes in the examples.
*	Added new optional attribute 'kind' related to 'namespace' attribute, so we use the same namespace for all the public identifiers
	of a data source, but we can distinguish among the different available subtypes, categories or ontologies.
*	'origin' attribute declared and generated in Java code for datasets is now 'kind'.


TODO
====

*	https://github.com/wolfgangmm/AtomicWiki
*	Implement function job:addBaseline, which injects 'baseline' elements, along with their 'timeStamp'.
*	Create infrastructure to add calls to the functions which will generate contents for 'baseline' element.

CHANGES TODO
============
*	Add assessment baseline results generation
	- For GOPHER, Blast search against UniProt Swiss-Prot with a cut-off
	  of 1e-3 and transfer GO annotation from UniProt entry.

1.-	Login box: with username field, password field, remember me checkbox, Forgot password link, Forgot username link, Login button, Sign up button.
	- Login button authenticates through AJAX with the server, setting up a cookie received from the server.
	  If authentication succeeds, the login box will translate into Logged Box. The container page could possibly reload (depending on context).
	  If authentication fails, the login box will show a brief error message.
	- 'Forgot password' link opens a new window where to write the username. The user will receive the password in any of the first confirmed e-mail address.
	- 'Forgot username' link opens a new window where to write any of the confirmed user e-mail addresses.
	- Sign Up button opens a new window where to write the needed information to ask for an account.
2.-	Logged box: with First and Last names, with username and image, Logout button, and a CSS menu with options like Edit profile, Manage Profiles, Manage Servers.
	- All this information will come from a service which will react to the cookie authentication token, returning an XML.
	- Logout button de-authenticates through AJAX with the server, clearing up the cookie received from the server.
	  The container page could possibly reload (depending on context).
	- 'Edit profile' links to the Profile page, tab 'User profile'. This will not appear for GOPHER admin.
	- 'Manage profiles' links to the Profile page, tab 'User profiles'. It only appears for GOPHER admin. This will not appear for other GOPHER users.
	- 'Manage Servers' links to the Profile page, tab 'Servers'.
3.- Main pages: They will include the Login/Logged boxes.
	- Boxes will appear on north-east corner.
	- Changes in Login/logged state will not reload these pages.
4.-	Profile page. This page will include the Logged box.
	- Box will appear on north-east corner.
	- Changes in Logged state will reload server main page.
	- The page contains next tabs. Some of them or their contents may not be rendered, based on GOPHER admin level:
		- Edit profile/Edit profile nickname: All the information associated to the user can be changed just here.
		  If it is not the admin profile, it will be an erase button.
