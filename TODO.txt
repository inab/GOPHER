1.-	Login box: with username field, password field, remember me checkbox, Forgot password link, Forgot username link, Login button, Sign up button.
	- Login button authenticates through AJAX with the server, setting up a cookie received from the server.
	  If authentication succeeds, the login box will translate into Logged Box. The container page could possibly reload (depending on context).
	  If authentication fails, the login box will show a brief error message.
	- 'Forgot password' link opens a new window where to write the username. The user will receive the password in any of the first confirmed e-mail address.
	- 'Forgot username' link opens a new window where to write any of the confirmed user e-mail addresses.
	- Sign Up button opens a new window where to write the needed information to ask for an account.
2.-	Logged box: with First and Last names, with username and image, Logout button, and a CSS menu with options like Edit profile, Manage Profiles, Manage Servers.
	- All this information will come from a service which will react to the cookie authentication token, returning an XML.
	- Logout button de-authenticates through AJAX with the server, clearing up the cookie received from the server.
	  The container page could possibly reload (depending on context).
